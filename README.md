This repository contains the demo codes for replicating results in our paper: 
[Majima K, Sukhanov P, Horikawa T, Kamitani Y (2017) "Position information encoded by population activity in hierarchical visual areas". eNeuro (in press).](http://eneuro.org/content/early/2017/03/23/ENEURO.0268-16.2017)

## fMRI data 
The fMRI data for five subjects are avairable from <http://brainliner.jp/data/brainliner/Position_Decoding>. 
Those should be included in the "data" folder.
The fMRI data were saved according to the BrainDecoderToolbox2 format <https://github.com/KamitaniLab/BrainDecoderToolbox2>.
